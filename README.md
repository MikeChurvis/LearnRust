# Mike Churvis Learns Rust

Why? Because...

- I like Python but miss type safety.
- I like TypeScript but tire of the explosive instability JS ecosystem.
- I appreciate low-level control but fear memory leaks and other such oversights.
- I'm getting back into game development and need a scalable performance powerhouse.
- I want to build desktop apps with maximal performance and minimal footprint.

How? By...

1. Reading the [Rust Programming Language Book](https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/) and reproducing all the tutorials therein.
1. Building a game with [Bevy](https://bevyengine.org).
1. Building a desktop app with [Tauri](https://github.com/tauri-apps/tauri).

Note:
> As I write this, I'm still training for a job in the Python sector of our industry. As such, this venture will be a backburner project for the foreseeable future.
